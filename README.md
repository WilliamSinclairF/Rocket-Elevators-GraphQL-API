# Let's get factual
you can find all the queries to answer the factIntervation related questions here => https://github.com/jorgemarcoux/Rocket_Elevators_GraphQL_API/blob/master/queries.md

if you aren't familiar with the requirements, they were the following:

- Retrieving the address of the building, the beginning and the end of the intervention for a specific intervention.
- Retrieving customer information and the list of interventions that took place for a specific building
- Retrieval of all interventions carried out by a specified employee with the buildings associated with these interventions including the details (Table BuildingDetails) associated with these buildings.

These questions had to be answered as part of the week 8 of the CodeBoxx bootcamp.


### info needed to set things up

- install Yarn to manage deps => https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/
- after Yarn is installed, run this command from the project directory: `yarn install`
- you should now be able to run the server, open your terminal and type in `yarn dev:start`
- assuming things go well, you can go to http://localhost:4000/graphql to check out the queries through GraphiQL
